        <p>Humanity will never fully become space-fairing without an economical solution to lifting mass beyond earths gravity.
        <p>I believe new and novel approaches are needed to unite sub-orbital airfoil lift technology with space exploration propulsion methods.</p>
        <p>I am investigating interactions of the electromagnetic spectrum with metamaterials and nano-engineered condensed matter to this end.</p>

        <p>I have begun investigations into machine learning by building a functioning quadrupedal robot. Equipped with machine vision via an infared capable camera. The main programming language is python running within a Linux environment on a Raspberry Pi.</p>

    <h2>Autobiography</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Kenneth Mikolaichik, a Texas native born 1990.
        I grew up in Austin the youngest of three and only boy, son of a chemist and a seamstress.
        I developed a knack for repairing everyday things at a young age.
        Ever hungry for more knowledge and spurred on by a desire to live comfortably, I attended the Liberal Arts and Science Academy High School in Austin.
        After High School I worked a plethora of temporary and remedial positions looking for my place in society.
        I attended ITT Tech in pursuit of an electrical engineering degree where I made the Deans list several times.
        While still attending online, I joined the US Navy and received training as an aircraft mechanic in Pensacola Florida where I achieved top of my class and class leader.
        I received an award and was promoted immediately to E-4.
        Within two years of my enlistment date I was promoted to E-5 wherein I became the second shift supervisor of ten F-18 Superhornets for the airframes shop of VFA-151.
        Upon exiting my military contact I resided in California for 2 years restoring dead and abandoned F-18’s that had not flown in years to pristine flight ready condition.
        It was around this time that I completed an associates in aeronautics from Embry Riddle.
        Missing my family, and longing for those Texas sunsets, I moved to San Antonio - Military City USA.
        I worked for Northrop Grumman for two years as a level III structural mechanic and then decided that was simply not enough; I needed to contribute to something more.
        This was when I decided to pursue a physics degree at the University of Texas and seriously investigate new approaches to lift and automated robotic repair.
		I volunteered my time for three years in Dr Xuan Zhou’s Optics lab within the Physics Department performing spectroscopic analysis of nanomaterials under high pressure and in 2025 I graduated with honors.
		I then began the formation of Mikolaichik Solutions LLC.
